# Graduate-Dropout-Classifier

## Description

Many students work hard in order to make it to college, only for them to be put in a potentially worse condition when they end up dropping out. This problem of students in higher education dropping out is the problem I seek to address. This corresponds to goal number four of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. By developing a model that can accurately classify which students are going to graduate and which are going to drop out schools will be able to determine which students are in most in need for help. Extra funds may be used to aid the students that are predicted to drop out perhaps directly through scholarships and grants, or through the creation of programs that will help those most at risk.

## Dataset

The data was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It was created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. This dataset has 4424 instances over 36 features, with each instance representing a student. The data is entirely numerical except for the target which is categorical. The problem is formulated as a three-category classification task, in which there is a strong imbalance towards one of the classes. The three categories being enrolled, dropout and graduate.
